* Company Org Table
** Summary

This package provides autocomptetion functionality in Org tables using
company. The completion candidates are by default the contents of other cells
in the same table column, but can also be predefined based on the table name
and column header.

** Installation

This package can be cloned from GitHub via the following command:

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/shankar2k/company-org-table.git
#+end_src

To start using it, place it somewhere in your Emacs load-path and add the line

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'company-org-table)
  (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-org-table)
#+end_src

in your ~.emacs.d/init.el~ file. 

If you use ~use-package~, you can configure this as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq company-org-table-load-path "<path to company-org-table dir>")
  (use-package company-org-table
    :load-path company-org-table-load-path
    :ensure nil
    :config
    (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-org-table))
#+end_src


** Usage

This package defines the following commands:

~company-org-table~: ~company-mode~ backend for Org tables that mimics the
auto-complete behavior of spreadsheet programs like Excel, LibreOffice, and
Google Sheets.

** Example

Suppose that you have the configuration below in your ~.emacs.d/init.el~ file to
help you keep track of language pack purchases from your userbase

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq user-list
        '("Alice" "Bob" "Carol" "Dave" "Eve" "Frank" "Grace" "Heidi" "Ivan"
          "Judy" "Ken" "Lisa" "Mike" "Nancy" "Olivia" "Pat" "Quentin" "Rupert"
          "Sybil" "Ted" "Ursula" "Victor" "Wendy" "Xavier" "Yusuf" "Zoe"))

  (add-to-list 'company-org-table-alist
               (cons (list "user-purchases" "User") (lambda () user-list)))

  (add-to-list 'company-org-table-alist
               (cons (list "user-purchases" "Language")
                     (lambda () (mapcar #'car language-info-alist))))
#+end_src
